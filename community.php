			<p><strong>What is Community Development Across the Southeast?</strong><br>
Through our Community Development Across the Southeast program, the Southeastern Credit Union Foundation has been coordinating efforts to assist credit unions in connecting with community partners, becoming low income designated and obtaining the Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) certification and coordinating efforts to apply for federal grant money through the U.S. Treasury for community development.</p>
			<p>The SECUF currently collaborates with CU Strategic Planning and Inclusiv to assist credit unions in becoming a CDFI and in applying for potential grant funding. Credit unions are encouraged to include a pledge to the SECUF as part of the Federal grant applications submitted  to continue to provide resources in community development.</p>
			<p><strong>What are the pledged funds used for?</strong><br>
With those funds, and the help of our other partners, we provide workshops, speakers, webinars and application assistance to credit unions interested in becoming a CDFI. We also use the pledged dollars to facilitate community  discussion groups and help certified credit unions brainstorm ideas for community development within their geographic footprint, to foster assistance in connecting the credit union with community partners and new clients. The SECUF also looks for new ways that credit unions can elevate their work within the communites they serve. </p>
			
			<p><strong>Community Involvement is Key. Discover YOUR &quot;Why&quot;.</strong></p>
			<p>By understanding our purpose and sharing our story, we can continue living the difference through credit unions. Explore the credit union difference through credit unions’ structure, operating principles and history. Link your personal core values with the values of the credit union movement and your organization to better understand your “why” and how we can live our values to meet existing and future challenges in the marketplace.</p>

              <div class="acc_content">
				  <p><strong>Join the Bank On Initiative</strong></p>
				  
				  <p><strong>The Challenge</strong><br>
Research from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shows that there are many reasons consumers lack a basic transaction account: not enough money for the minimum balance; distrust of financial institutions; high or unpredictable fees; or identification, credit or banking history problems. Many Americans are driven to use expensive alternative financial services, including check cashers, payday lenders, and pawn shops that charge high fees for financial services that fail to help people get ahead. Without a checking account, families wind up paying too much for basic financial transactions and are hard pressed to build savings and assets.</p>
				  
				  <p><strong>Quick Facts:</strong></p>
				  
				  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
				  <li>Close to 7% of U.S. households (approximately 14 million adults) are “unbanked,” without a checking or savings account.</li>
					  <li>Almost 20% of U.S. households (approximately 50 million adults) are underbanked, meaning they still use some fringe financial services.</li>
					  <li>Nearly 37% of unbanked and 45% of underbanked households earn less than $30,000 per year.</li>
					  <li>Nationally, more than half of black households and 46% of Hispanic households are unbanked or underbanked, compared to less than 20% of white households.</li>
				  </ul>
				  
				  <p>Why do basic transaction accounts matter?</p>
				  
				  <p>A basic transaction account is an important first step in establishing a mainstream banking relationship, depositing earnings securely, accessing credit, and saving for the future. Unbanked and underbanked individuals lose the cost savings and stabilizing benefits such an account provides, such as:</p>
				  
				  <ul style="list-style: disc;">
				  <li>Cost savings: The average unbanked person spends 5% of net income on unnecessary fees for alternative financial services. This can amount to $40,000 over a lifetime—a significant amount for those who can least afford it.</li>
					  <li>Asset building: Without a bank account, a family lacks the ability to save reliably or automatically, or establish a banking relationship that can lead to accessing affordable credit for opportunities like a car, small business, or home mortgage.</li>
					  <li>Public safety: Without a safe place to deposit their money, unbanked people are more likely to be victims of crime because they often carry large sums of cash with them or keep cash in their homes. Elderly, disabled, or undocumented immigrants can be particularly vulnerable.</li>
					  <li>Financial stability: Research shows that being unbanked makes it harder to achieve financial goals like reducing debt and improving credit scores.</li>
				  </ul>
				  
				  <p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
				  
				  <p><strong>The CFE (Cities for Financial Empowerment) Fund works directly with national and regional financial institutions to encourage the widespread availability of safe, low cost transactional products.</strong></p>
				  
				  <p>One key challenge facing unbanked and underbanked individuals has been a lack of safe and appropriate accounts offered by mainstream financial institutions, particularly those without overdraft.</p>
				  
				  <p>The CFE Fund has worked closely with the Bank On National Advisory Board and other key stakeholders to develop the Bank On National Account Standards. Inspired by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Model Safe Accounts Template, these standards provide local programs with a benchmark for account partnerships with financial institutions, including their local partners.</p>

              <div class="acc_head">Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) Program</div>
              <div class="acc_content">
				  <p>More than ever, 2020 has shown a spotlight on the incredible impact that  credit unions make in their communities.&nbsp; Whether it&rsquo;s working around the  clock to process Payment Protection Program loans, participating in social  justice initiatives or giving their employees time off to vote, credit unions  have consistently demonstrated their commitment to serving the needs of their  communities.<br>
But equitably meeting those needs in minority or low-income communities  takes commitment and innovation.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where the U.S. Treasury  Department&rsquo;s Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) Program can  help.<br>
Created by Congress in 1994, the CDFI program was designed to combine  federal money with private capital to help qualified financial institutions  meet the need of under-served communities that typically lack access to  affordable loans and safe financial services.<br>
&ldquo;<em>When we looked at the  needs within our community, we knew it was just too large a problem to solve on  our own.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why we started looking into the CDFI program</em>,&rdquo;  says Kirk Mills, CEO of St. Louis Community Credit Union.&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>As an example, we wanted to offer  consumers an affordable alternative to predatory financial products and help  get our members off the payday loan merry-go-round.</em>&nbsp; <em>The benefits and grants from the CDFI  program have allowed us to focus more of our lending activities on minority and  low-income members who need it most</em>.&rdquo;</p>
				  <p><span class="text">For more information about the certification, please review the video series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8ZP8lPCB9Y" target="_blank">CDFI — Introduction and Overview</a>.</span></p>
				  <p>CUNA Mutual Group, in partnership with Inclusiv and with the support of the Southeastern Credit Union Foundation, is launching a CDFI Campaign. The program aims to educate  credit unions not currently CDFI certified about the benefits of certification  in serving members and local small businesses, and to create a network for  existing CDFI credit unions to learn about and access additional resources. </p>
				  <p>As part of the awareness  and certification campaign, Inclusiv will conduct an analysis of credit unions  in target areas and provide technical assistance to credit unions interested in  pursuing CDFI certification as well as to previously CDFI-certified credit  unions whose certifications have lapsed. Inclusiv will be providing CDFI  eligibility and certification services, along with training and technical  assistance for CDFIs participating in the various CDFI Fund programs. Inclusiv  is also hosting weekly learning sessions for credit unions that would like to  learn more. </p>
				  <p><strong>Current CDFI Credit Unions are eligible to apply for a portion of the $1.25Billion allocated to CDFI by February 25th. </strong></p>
				  <p>Priority for this first round of funds is likely to be given to Minority Depository Institutions. To have this designation, your credit union must:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Have a membership that is more than half minority.</li>
                    <li>Have a Board that is more than half minority. </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>These qualifications should be self-reported by the credit union to the NCUA. More information can be found <a href="https://www.ncua.gov/support-services/credit-union-resources-expansion/resources/minority-depository-institution-preservation" target="_blank">HERE</a>. </p>

			      </p>
				  <p><strong>Benefits of the CDFI  Program </strong><br>
				    Mission driven credit unions are dedicated to financial inclusion, and the  ability to apply for capital or technical assistance grants is often a top draw  for credit unions. &nbsp;In September 2020, the CDFI fund awarded grants  totaling $45.8M to 111 credit unions.<br>
				    Additional benefits of the CDFI program include:</p>
                  <ul type="disc">
                    <li>Access to additional training resources.</li>
                    <li>Exemption from the NCUA&rsquo;s member business lending cap.</li>
                    <li>Membership in a learning community of like-minded       credit unions to share ideas.</li>
                    <li>Limited exemptions under the CFPB Qualified Mortgage       and Ability-to-Pay rules.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>What a CDFI Credit  Union Looks Like</strong><br>
                </p>
                  <p>Not every credit union will qualify as a CDFI.&nbsp; There are seven tests  for CDFI certification, most of which are automatic or easily fulfilled by most  credit unions.&nbsp; A good CDFI candidate makes it their primary mission to  provide development services like financial education and coaching for those  community members who need it most.&nbsp; That commitment can be seen in the  makeup of their governing or advisory boards, providing a reflection of the  communities they serve.<br>
                    The real hallmark of a CDFI credit union is that their lending activities  are predominantly focused on target populations in economically depressed  areas, low-income communities, or other historically under-served populations.<br>
  </p>
                  <p><strong>Dispelling the Myths</strong><br>
                  </p>
                  <p>It&rsquo;s a common misperception that the CDFI certification is primarily for  small credit unions.&nbsp; In fact, asset size is not a qualifying factor and  currently there are 39 CDFI certified credit unions with more than $1 billion  in assets. &nbsp;But the impact of CDFI grant dollars is magnified in a small  credit union.<br>
                    &ldquo;<em>We are a $50M credit  union with only 22-1/2 staff members</em>,&rdquo; says Kate Laud, President  and CEO of Opportunities Credit Union in Vermont. &ldquo;<em>We&rsquo;ve gotten multiple grants from the CDFI fund.&nbsp;  Those dollars have helped us run our business efficiently and cost  effectively.&nbsp; The result has been increased lending for immigrants,  minorities and low-income members in every county in Vermont.&rdquo;</em><br>
                    Because of the low mortgage rates, Opportunities Credit Union has seen  mortgage activity in 2020 equal to 270% of their 2020 plan.&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>Over a third of our mortgages in 2020  have been made to immigrants and refugees,&rdquo;</em> says Laud.<br>
                    Another common misperception is that it is just too risky to focus on  under-served communities.&nbsp; Terry Ratigan from <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inclusiv.org%2Fabout-us%2F&data=04%7C01%7CJuli.Lewis%40lscu.coop%7C17e3c129e7bf4c2ed8f408d89bc03157%7C35d0fbd62b1c432a96dbbeb69180cfc3%7C1%7C0%7C637430597058211185%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=8%2FnUO8sEUiWkZXp%2FP6VNUktmGWmDKJGzKOaG73m6GsU%3D&reserved=0"><strong>Inclusiv</strong></a> states that their research shows quite the opposite.<br>
                    <em>&ldquo;The median community  development credit union actually outperforms the median non-CDFI in earnings,  lending, asset growth and membership growth,&rdquo;</em> says Ratigan.&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;We have documented these results in  both our 2018 and 2020 Inclusive Finance reports.&rdquo;</em><br>
                    Comparable findings have been independently reported by NCUA and CUNA in  public presentations.<br>
                </p>
                  <p><strong>Becoming and Staying  CDFI Certified </strong><br>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some credit unions may feel they just don&rsquo;t have the time to pull together  the data and the application to initially become certified.&nbsp; That time  invested directly translates into benefits for your members.<em>&nbsp; &ldquo;You have to understand your  WHY--you don&rsquo;t become a CDFI unless it is truly part of your mission and  business strategy as a credit union.&nbsp; It takes intentional commitment  expanding who you serve and you have to be able to demonstrate your plan for  any grant dollars received from the CDFI fund,&rdquo;</em> says Mills.<br>
                    Applications for CDFI certification can be accepted any time but there are  two times a year (September and March) where the NCUA offers a streamlined  application window.&nbsp; This can significantly reduce the data gathering  burden for credit unions.<br>
                </p>
                  <p><strong>Taking Action</strong><br>
                  </p>
                  <p>As a League, we are committed to the success of credit unions.&nbsp;  Government funding for the program can change from year-to-year and there are  currently legislative proposals for unprecedented levels of funding.&nbsp; We  want to make sure all credit unions who qualify can take advantage of all CDFI  benefits.&nbsp; Inclusiv is holding weekly informational meetings for credit  unions interested in the CDFI program.&nbsp; Again, register here to learn more:<strong>&nbsp; </strong><a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.office.com%2FPages%2FResponsePage.aspx%3Fid%3D_VIEoGmEnkCRqLt6AI4toHSFhuv9iGNHirmYo--8YMtUQ1UxVFA5U1REQTNSVUxGMUVPVUpOOU1RTS4u&data=04%7C01%7CJuli.Lewis%40lscu.coop%7C17e3c129e7bf4c2ed8f408d89bc03157%7C35d0fbd62b1c432a96dbbeb69180cfc3%7C1%7C0%7C637430597058211185%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=rV7s7QqEQ9cHeZvPl25ofQRPkPWkSwrRpQvx2dGXJPA%3D&reserved=0" target="_blank"><strong>CDFI Education Sign-up</strong></a></p>

       			<p>The Southeastern Credit Union Foundation partnered with Avadian CU and the Metro Birmingham Children’s Business Fair to hold a Biz Kids workshop on Saturday, 11/02 at the UAB football practice Legacy Pavilion. Kids learned what it takes to start a business and will be working on their own business ideas for a showcase in April!</p>
				  
				  <p><em>It was so nice to meet you and everyone at the workshop Saturday. You all breathed life and excitement into Shea and Claire, they are still flying high. They can't wait for the next gathering. We have had a rough couple of years and this was a great encouragement for all of us! Thank you for all your hard work and travel to make this happen. We will not take this opportunity for granted!<br>~Parent of 2 BizKid Workshop Attendees</em></p>
